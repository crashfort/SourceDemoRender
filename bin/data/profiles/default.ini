# This is the default profile that gets used when no other profile is specified. This is meant as a 
# general case profile and may not match your needs exactly. This does not have the perfect quality but aims for
# a good balance of quality and speed and compatibility. You can copy this file and rename it to make
# your own profiles. You can then use your new profile when starting the movie like this:
# startmovie a.mp4 my_profile
# The above command will select the my_profile.ini file in this same directory.

# The constant framerate to use for the movie. Whole numbers only.

# The video encoder to use for the movie. Available options are libx264 or libx264rgb.
# For YUV video, libx264 is used with the NV12 pixel format. For RGB video, libx264rgb is used with the BGR0.
# pixel format. There may be compatibility issues with libx264rgb but it produces the highest quality.
video_encoder=libx264

# The constant rate factor to use for the movie. This is the direct link between quality and file size.
# Using 0 here produces lossless video, but may cause the video stream to not be supported in some media players.
# This should be between 0 and 52. A lower value means better quality but larger file size.

# The quality vs speed to use for encoding the movie. Basically how much time to spend on on quality for each frame.
# This can be one of ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo.
# A slower preset may decrease the file size, will produce slightly better quality but will significantly slow down
# the processing speed.
# A faster preset can create worse quality and will create larger files but will be much faster.

# This decides whether or not the video stream will consist only of keyframes.
